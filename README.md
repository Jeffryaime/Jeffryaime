# 👋 Hi, I’m Jeff

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, especially full-stack projects where I can utilize and expand my skills in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I’m passionate about building scalable and efficient applications that enhance user experiences.

- 🌱 I recently graduated from a two-month intensive bootcamp in web development and am currently deepening my knowledge in advanced JavaScript techniques and exploring cloud services to broaden my development skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or startups that are focused on innovation in the tech industry. I’m particularly excited about projects that aim to improve accessibility and user engagement through creative web solutions.
